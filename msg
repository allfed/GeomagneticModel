Binning corrected.

Modified MTsite 'ranking and winnowing' algorithm as in Love, 2018 so one storm doesn't dominate the repeat rate plots. Confirmed algorithm produces similar rate per years as Love, 2018 and Love, 2019 with VAQ55 and VAQ58, and FRD. Incorporated own addition to algorithm which provides a running average by duration.
