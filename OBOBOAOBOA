       IIwwccoonnffiigg is similar to _i_f_c_o_n_f_i_g(8), but is dedicated to the wire‐
       less interfaces. It is used to set the parameters of the  network
       interface which are specific to the wireless operation (for exam‐
       ple : the frequency).  IIwwccoonnffiigg may also be used to display those
       parameters,   and   the   wireless   statistics  (extracted  from
       _/_p_r_o_c_/_n_e_t_/_w_i_r_e_l_e_s_s).

       All these parameters and statistics are  device  dependent.  Each
       driver  will provide only some of them depending on hardware sup‐
       port, and the range of values may change. Please refer to the man
       page of each device for details.

       eessssiidd  Set  the  ESSID (or Network Name - in some products it may
              also be called Domain ID). The ESSID is used  to  identify
              cells which are part of the same virtual network.
              As opposed to the AP Address or NWID which define a single
              cell, the ESSID defines a group of cells connected via re‐
              peaters  or infrastructure, where the user may roam trans‐
              parently.
              With some cards, you may disable the ESSID checking (ESSID
              promiscuous) with _o_f_f or _a_n_y (and _o_n to reenable it).
              If  the  ESSID  of your network is one of the special key‐
              words (_o_f_f, _o_n or _a_n_y), you should use _-_- to escape it.

       nnwwiidd   Set the Network ID.  As  all  adjacent  wireless  networks
              share the same medium, this parameter is used to differen‐
              tiate them (create logical colocated networks)  and  iden‐
              tify nodes belonging to the same cell.
              This  parameter  is only used for pre-802.11 hardware, the
              802.11 protocol uses the ESSID and  AP  Address  for  this
              function.
              With  some  cards, you may disable the Network ID checking
              (NWID promiscuous) with _o_f_f (and _o_n to reenable it).

       ffrreeqq/cchhaannnneell
              Set  the  operating  frequency or channel in the device. A
              value below 1000  indicates  a  channel  number,  a  value
              greater than 1000 is a frequency in Hz. You may append the
              suffix k, M or G to the value (for  example,  "2.46G"  for
              2.46 GHz frequency), or add enough '0'.
              Channels  are  usually numbered starting at 1, and you may
              use _i_w_l_i_s_t(8) to get the total number  of  channels,  list
              the  available  frequencies,  and display the current fre‐
              quency as a channel. Depending on regulations,  some  fre‐
              quencies/channels may not be available.
              When  using Managed mode, most often the Access Point dic‐
              tates the channel and the driver may refuse the setting of
              the  frequency.  In Ad-Hoc mode, the frequency setting may
              only be used at initial cell creation, and may be  ignored
              when joining an existing cell.
              You  may  also use _o_f_f or _a_u_t_o to let the card pick up the
              best channel (when supported).

       aapp     Force the card to register to the Access  Point  given  by
              the  address,  if it is possible. This address is the cell
              identity of the Access  Point,  as  reported  by  wireless
              scanning,  which may be different from its network MAC ad‐
              dress. If the wireless link is point to point, set the ad‐
              dress of the other end of the link. If the link is ad-hoc,
              set the cell identity of the ad-hoc network.
              When the quality of  the  connection  goes  too  low,  the
              driver may revert back to automatic mode (the card selects
              the best Access Point in range).
              You may also use _o_f_f to re-enable automatic  mode  without
              changing  the  current Access Point, or you may use _a_n_y or
              _a_u_t_o to force the card to reassociate with  the  currently
              best Access Point.

       rraattee/bbiitt[rate]
              For  cards supporting multiple bit rates, set the bit-rate
              in b/s. The bit-rate is the speed at which bits are trans‐
              mitted  over  the  medium,  the  user speed of the link is
              lower due to medium sharing and various overhead.
              You may append the suffix k, M or G to the value  (decimal
              multiplier  : 10^3, 10^6 and 10^9 b/s), or add enough '0'.
              Values below 1000 are card specific, usually an  index  in
              the  bit-rate  list. Use _a_u_t_o to select automatic bit-rate
              mode (fallback to lower rate on noisy channels), which  is
              the  default  for  most cards, and _f_i_x_e_d to revert back to
              fixed setting. If you specify a bit-rate value and  append
              _a_u_t_o,  the  driver  will use all bit-rates lower and equal
              than this value.

              transmit  power  in  dBm.  If  _W is the power in Watt, the
              power in dBm is _P _= _3_0 _+ _1_0_._l_o_g_(_W_).  If the value is post‐
              fixed by _m_W, it will be automatically converted to dBm.
              In  addition, _o_n and _o_f_f enable and disable the radio, and
              _a_u_t_o and _f_i_x_e_d enable and disable power control (if  those

       sseennss   Set  the  sensitivity threshold. This define how sensitive
              is the card to poor operating conditions (low signal,  in‐
              terference).  Positive  values  are  assumed to be the raw
              value used by the hardware or a percentage, negative  val‐
              ues  are  assumed to be dBm. Depending on the hardware im‐
              plementation, this parameter  may  control  various  func‐
              tions.
              On  modern  cards,  this  parameter  usually  control han‐
              dover/roaming threshold, the lowest signal level for which
              the  hardware  remains  associated with the current Access
              Point. When the signal level goes below this threshold the
              card  starts  looking  for a new/better Access Point. Some
              cards may use the number  of  missed  beacons  to  trigger
              this.  For high density of Access Points, a higher thresh‐
              old make sure the card is always associated with the  best
              AP, for low density of APs, a lower threshold minimise the
              number of failed handoffs.
              On more ancient card this parameter usually  controls  the
              defer  threshold,  the  lowest  signal level for which the
              hardware considers the channel busy. Signal  levels  above
              this  threshold  make the hardware inhibits its own trans‐
              mission whereas signals weaker than this are  ignored  and
              the hardware is free to transmit. This is usually strongly
              linked to the receive threshold, the lowest  signal  level
              for  which  the hardware attempts packet reception. Proper
              setting of these thresholds prevent the card to waste time
              on  background  noise while still receiving weak transmis‐
              sions. Modern designs seems to  control  those  thresholds
              automatically.

       rreettrryy  Most cards have MAC retransmissions, and some allow to set
              the behaviour of the retry mechanism.
              To set the maximum number of retries, enter _l_i_m_i_t _`_v_a_l_u_e_'.
              This  is an absolute value (without unit), and the default
              (when nothing is specified).  To set the maximum length of

              faults, this value is in seconds, append the suffix m or u
              to specify values in milliseconds or microseconds.
              You  can  also add the _s_h_o_r_t, _l_o_n_g, _m_i_n and _m_a_x modifiers.
              If the card  supports  automatic  mode,  they  define  the
              bounds  of  the limit or lifetime. Some other cards define
              different values depending on packet size, for example  in
              802.11  _m_i_n  _l_i_m_i_t  is  the short retry limit (non RTS/CTS

              to  make  sure  that the channel is clear. This adds over‐
              head, but increases performance in case of hidden nodes or
              a  large  number  of active nodes. This parameter sets the
              size of the smallest packet for which the node sends RTS ;
              a  value  equal  to  the  maximum packet size disables the
              mechanism. You may also set this parameter to _a_u_t_o,  _f_i_x_e_d
              or _o_f_f.

              Fragmentation  allows  to split an IP packet in a burst of
              smaller fragments transmitted on the medium. In most cases
              this  adds  overhead, but in a very noisy environment this
              reduces the error penalty and allow packets to get through
              interference bursts. This parameter sets the maximum frag‐
              ment size which is always lower than  the  maximum  packet
              size.
              This  parameter  may also control Frame Bursting available
              on some cards, the ability to send multiple IP packets to‐
              gether.  This  mechanism  would be enabled if the fragment
              size is larger than the maximum packet size.
              You may also set this parameter to _a_u_t_o, _f_i_x_e_d or _o_f_f.

              Used to manipulate encryption or scrambling keys and secu‐
              rity mode.
              To  set  the current encryption key, just enter the key in
              hex digits as _X_X_X_X_-_X_X_X_X_-_X_X_X_X_-_X_X_X_X or _X_X_X_X_X_X_X_X.  To  set  a
              key  other than the current key, prepend or append _[_i_n_d_e_x_]
              to the key itself (this won't change which is  the  active
              key). You can also enter the key as an ASCII string by us‐
              ing the _s_: prefix. Passphrase is currently not supported.
              To change which key is the currently active key, just  en‐
              ter _[_i_n_d_e_x_] (without entering any key value).
              _o_f_f and _o_n disable and reenable encryption.
              The security mode may be _o_p_e_n or _r_e_s_t_r_i_c_t_e_d, and its mean‐
              ing depends on the card used. With  most  cards,  in  _o_p_e_n
              mode  no  authentication is used and the card may also ac‐
              cept non-encrypted sessions, whereas  in  _r_e_s_t_r_i_c_t_e_d  mode
              only encrypted sessions are accepted and the card will use
              authentication if available.
              If you need to set multiple keys, or set a key and  change
              the  active  key, you need to use multiple kkeeyy directives.
              Arguments can be put in any order, the last one will  take
              precedence.

              Force  the card to use a specific set of modulations. Mod‐
              ern cards support  various  modulations,  some  which  are
              standard,  such  as  802.11b  or 802.11g, and some propri‐
              etary. This command force the card to only  use  the  spe‐
              cific  set of modulations listed on the command line. This
              can be used to fix interoperability issues.
              The  list  of  available   modulations   depend   on   the
              card/driver  and can be displayed using _i_w_l_i_s_t _m_o_d_u_l_a_t_i_o_n.
              Note that some card/driver may not be able to select  each
              modulation listed independently, some may come as a group.
              You  may  also  set  this  parameter  to  _a_u_t_o   let   the

              _i_f_c_o_n_f_i_g).  This command (when available) forces the  card
              to apply all pending changes.
              This is normally not needed, because the card will eventu‐
              ally apply the changes, but can be useful for debugging.

       The parameters displayed have the same meaning and values as  the
       parameters  you  can set, please refer to the previous part for a
       detailed explanation of them.
       Some parameters are  only  displayed  in  short/abbreviated  form
       (such  as  encryption).  You may use _i_w_l_i_s_t(8) to get all the de‐
       tails.
       Some parameters have two modes (such as bitrate). If the value is
       prefixed  by `==', it means that the parameter is fixed and forced
       to that value, if it is prefixed by `::', the parameter is in  au‐
       tomatic mode and the current value is shown (and may change).

       AAcccceessss PPooiinntt/CCeellll
              An  address equal to 00:00:00:00:00:00 means that the card
              failed to associate with an Access Point  (most  likely  a
              configuration  issue).  The AAcccceessss PPooiinntt parameter will be
              shown as CCeellll in ad-hoc mode (for  obvious  reasons),  but
              otherwise works the same.

       If _/_p_r_o_c_/_n_e_t_/_w_i_r_e_l_e_s_s exists, _i_w_c_o_n_f_i_g will also display its con‐
       tent. Note that those values will depend on the  driver  and  the
       hardware  specifics, so you need to refer to your driver documen‐
       tation for proper interpretation of those values.

              how good the received signal is, some timing  synchronisa‐

       RRxx iinnvvaalliidd ffrraagg
              Number  of  packets for which the hardware was not able to
              properly re-assemble the link layer fragments (most likely

              Number  of  packets  that  the hardware failed to deliver.
              Most MAC protocols will retry the packet a number of times
              before giving up.

       IInnvvaalliidd mmiisscc
              Other  packets lost in relation with specific wireless op‐
              erations.

              vals to maintain the cell coordination, failure to receive
              them usually indicates that the card is out of range.
